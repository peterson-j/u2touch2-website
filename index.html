    <h2 class="section-title">Engineering the Future of Dental Care</h2>
    <p>U2 Touch2 Solutions LLP is a deep-tech venture reimagining oral healthcare at scale. We are using AI, diagnostics, mathematical modeling and optimzation and are designing intelligent tools that detect oral anomalies early, model disease progression, and guide patients to timely, affordable treatment — from first image to final intervention.</p>
    <p><strong>The problem is massive.</strong><br>
    90% of Indians have underlying oral issues — but don’t know it.<br>
    And when they do, 70% delay treatment due to high cost.</p>
    <p><strong>This isn’t just a health gap — it’s an insight gap.</strong><br>
    We help users understand what’s happening in their mouths, what could happen if left untreated, and what action they can take — all from a simple image taken on a mobile phone or intraoral camera.</p>
    <p>We believe early oral intervention is the next frontier in preventive care. And we’re building the rails for it — today.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="brain">
    <h2 class="section-title">Brain Behind the Bite</h2>
    <p>Dr. R’s AI engine brings precision diagnosis into the first mile of care — without relying on costly, radiation‑based diagnostics. Our platform is built to work from a simple selfie or video, captured on a smartphone or intra‑oral camera, making early detection accessible to anyone, anywhere.</p>
    <p>Our system doesn’t just detect anomalies — it models how issues may progress over time, estimates future treatment complexity and cost, and helps users act early. As the platform learns, our proprietary “Oral Quotient Score” quantifies how orally fit a person is in relation to their overall health — giving individuals and care providers a clear, actionable metric.</p>
    <p>We’re also building a voice‑based conversational layer to democratize access even further, especially for non‑literate or non‑digital users. This isn’t just an AI tool — it’s an intelligent bridge between oral neglect and oral action, built for scale, grounded in data, and designed to compound advantage over time.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="practice">
    <h2 class="section-title">Power Your Practice with U2 Touch2</h2>
    <p><strong>Smart Leads, No Guesswork</strong><br>
    We screen thousands in schools and communities, identify issues early, and map them to local clinics.  You get patients with known oral concerns — no cold outreach, just warm, ready leads.</p>
    <p><strong>Diagnose Better with AI</strong><br>
    Our platform gives you diagnostic support from first image to final treatment.<br>
    Simplify detection, reduce reliance on complex tools, and treat with confidence — every time.</p>
    <p><strong>Stay Ahead, Stay Connected</strong><br>
    Track each patient’s progress, access case insights, and build trust with consistent, data-backed care.  We bring continuity, you deliver impact.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="smile">
    <h2 class="section-title">From Screening to Saving Smiles</h2>
    <p>We conduct oral health awareness & screening camps in schools, colleges, and communities using our image-based AI platform. With over 80% of individuals carrying untreated oral issues, our low-cost model makes early detection accessible — and affordable — compared to traditional dental consultations.</p>
    <p>Want to host an oral health screening or awareness camp in your community, school, college, or locality? Whether you're planning a large outreach or a small setup, we're here to support you. Call <strong>+91 99459 42416</strong> for a quick chat — and let’s get started.</p>
